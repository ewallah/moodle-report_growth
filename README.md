The Growth report plugin is a Moodle plugin that collects information for management. 

### Introduction
Ever wondered when all those users arrived at the platform? When people started to use their mobile phone?
When all those questions arrived in the question bank?  The growth report shows how your Moodle has grown 
using graphs.

Management can use these numbers to make decissions. But the info can also be helpfull for admins and
Moodle managers, therefore we added category based reports. But also teachers can use this report in a
course to get a better overview what happened when.

### Installation

* Unzip code into the report/growth directory
* Log into Moodle as administrator.

### Bug Reports / Support

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform, database, PHP and
Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on GitHub: https://github.com/ewallah/moodle-report_growth/issues.
Please provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if applicable, a screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub https://github.com/ewallah/moodle-report_growth/pulls.
If we consider the request generally useful and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the resources to provide
detailed support.
