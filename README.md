### Bug Reports / Support ###

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform, database, PHP and
Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on GitHub. Please provide a detailed bug description, including
the plugin and Moodle version and, if applicable, a screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful and if it can be
implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the resources to provide
detailed support.
